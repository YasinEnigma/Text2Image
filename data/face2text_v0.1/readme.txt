Description
-----
Face2Text is an ongoing project to collect a dataset of natural language descriptions of human faces. 400 randomly selected images were used from the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) and put on a website where people were asked to write descriptions of each face. See paper for more information.

The dataset is provided in json format structured as a list of objects consisiting of the following:
    img_id: A unique id referring to an image of a face.
    image: The directory of the image file.
    descriptions: A list of objects consisting of:
        desc_id: A unique description id
        text: A string description of the image.

Here is an example:
    [
        "img_id": 198,
        "image": "Adam_Ant/Adam_Ant_0001.bmp",
        "descriptions": [
            {
                "desc_id": 979,
                "text": "big face yellow hair, big ears long nose"
            },
            ...
        ],
        ...
    ]

The image directory refers to a face photo in the Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset (http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz). We do not include images here; you will need to download them and select them separately.

A cleaned version of the dataset has been provided. Only minor superficial changes have been made but we intend to perform a more thorough cleaning in future versions. In order to filter some of the garbage submissions, only descriptions that contain a space were included in the dataset. Spaces at the beginning or end of a description were removed. Spaces before or after a new line where removed. Multiple consecutive spaces were replaced with a single space. Non-English descriptions were removed.
